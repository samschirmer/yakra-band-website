    <div>
      <p>
        Yakra is a name that comes from an ancient story about a boy that learned his planet was fated to be consumed by an intergalactic parasite. 
        Upon learning this, he assembled a party and set out to kill the space leech, at great expense to himself and others he loved. 
        Yakra was the name of a beast he slew on his journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yakra (the band) is comprised of <a href="https://samschirmer.com">Sam Schirmer</a>, a nerd from St. Louis, MO. That's it.

        This album is comprised of riffs I've been writing since I was a teenager. Those years have gotten further and further away from me, 
        and I decided to finally sit down and take a real crack and getting things tracked and released. Why? I don't know. I expect very few 
        people will like any of this music. That's fine with me.

        This record is the culmination of decades of, well, fucking around with a guitar with no real purpose, but with the eventual goal of releasing <em>something</em>.
      </p>
      <p>This is that something.</p>

      <h1 class="green">Gear Used</h1>
      <p>I'm a sucker for this stuff, so here it all is.</p>
      <p>
        All distorted rhythm guitars are an SG standard loaded with SD Black Winters. All clean guitars are a telecaster with Texas Specials. 
        Lead guitars are split between the SG, a strat, a couple telecasters, and an old Electra LP copy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Guitars were recorded through a Marshall DSL20, an old 70s Univox 2x10, and an Orange 4x12 into Shure SM57s plugged into a Universal Audio Volt2. 
        The only real pedals used were an EQD Westwood and a Way Huge Red Llama. 
      </p>
      <p>
        All basslines were a Precision bass (with flats) recorded directly into the interface. Except one part of one song... that was an old lawsuit Harmony copy with rounds.
      </p>  
      <p>
        Drums were all performed by Logan, the drummer that came with Logic Pro. I helped him out with a midi keyboard from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recording and mixing were performed (poorly) by me in Logic Pro, while mastering was performed by an AI plugin from Exonic. 
      </p>
      <p>And that's the story of how you can take a bunch of money and turn it into a mediocre-sounding record.</p>
