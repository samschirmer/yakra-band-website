    <div>
      <p>
        Yakra is a name that comes from an ancient story about a boy that learned his planet was fated to be consumed by an intergalactic parasite. 
        Upon learning this, he assembled a party and set out to kill the space leech, at great expense to himself and others he loved. 
        Yakra was the name of a beast he slew on his journey.

        Yakra (the band) is comprised of <a href="https://samschirmer.com">Sam Schirmer</a>, a nerd from St. Louis, MO. That's it.

        This album is comprised of riffs I've been writing since I was a teenager. Those years have gotten further and further away from me, 
        and I decided to finally sit down and take a real crack and getting things tracked and released. Why? I don't know. I expect very few 
        people will like any of this music. That's fine with me.

        This record is the culmination of decades of, well, fucking around with a guitar with no real purpose, but with the eventual goal of releasing <em>something</em>.
      </p>
      <p>This is that something.</p>
